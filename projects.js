From socioeconomic factors to bilingualism, there is interest on how these factors can affect a child’s development. In particular, there has been much research focused on the development of children’s Theory of Mind (ToM), or how a child is able to understand their own and others’ minds. In this project, we explored the potential impacts of factors such as language and executive functioning performance in children’s development. Specifically, we sought to analyze the question: What is the role of executive functioning and language skills in theory of mind performance in bilingual versus monolingual children?", "Contact me for the research paper."],

The logistic regression model correctly predicted superhost status 70.66% of the time on the test set, with a sensitivity value of 0.6748 and a specificity value of 0.7395. The classification tree correctly predicted superhost status 83.87% of the time on the test set, with the 3 predictor variables used in the tree construction are `number_of_reviews`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `review_scores_rating`.", "Both modeling techniques identified `number_of_reviews` and `review_scores_rating` as the most significant predictors in predicting whether or not a host is a superhost. Thus, the most reliable way to predict superhost status is most likely by finding out how many 5-star reviews a host has.", "Link to download the academic poster we presented"],
