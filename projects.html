          For this project, I worked with Professor Peter De Villiers to build models for exploring Theory of Mind differences between monolingual and bilingual children. 
          <br><br>
          Children grow in a variety of environments with different factors that can affect their development. From socioeconomic factors to bilingualism, there is interest on how these factors can affect a child’s development. In particular, there has been much research focused on the development of children’s Theory of Mind (ToM), or how a child is able to understand their own and others’ minds. In this project, we explored the potential impacts of factors such as language and executive functioning performance in children’s development. Specifically, we sought to analyze the question: What is the role of executive functioning and language skills in theory of mind performance in bilingual versus monolingual children?

          The objective of this project is to attempt to find the factors that can best predict whether a host is a superhost on Airbnb, utilizing the dataset available at <a href = "http://www.airbnb.com/help/article/828/what-is-a-superhost">link</a>.
          <br><br> We utilized two modeling techniques - logistic regression and classification tree. The logistic regression model correctly predicted superhost status 70.66% of the time on the test set, with a sensitivity value of 0.6748 and a specificity value of 0.7395.
          The classification tree correctly predicted superhost status 83.87% of the time on the test set, with the 3 predictor variables used in the tree construction are `number_of_reviews`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `review_scores_rating`.
          <br><br> Both modeling techniques identified `number_of_reviews` and `review_scores_rating` as
          the most significant predictors in predicting whether or not a host is a superhost. Thus, the most
          reliable way to predict superhost status is most likely by finding out how many 5-star reviews a
          host has.

          As part of one of my academic final projects, I was told to write a paper on anything I discovered in the town of my college (Northampton, MA). 
          <br><br>
          For this topic, I chose to write about a Dr. Seuss exhibit I found in the town's local museum. Dr. Seuss's hometown is Springfield, MA, which is less than 10 minutes away from Northampton. 
          <br><br>
          As part of the project, I also created a youtube video summarizing my findings. You can find the youtube video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fD3JglPQXs"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fD3JglPQXs</a>. Contact me for the full research paper.
