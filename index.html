          I graduated a little over a year ago from Smith College as a double major in Computer Science and Statistical Data Sciences. During my time at Smith, I spent my days doing things like conducting statistical research projects with elementary school children, contributing to open source coding projects and learning tai chi.
          <br> 
          <br>
          Since then, I've been coding away at Palantir Technologies as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer. At Palantir, I could be building a data pipeline one second and watching someone use my dashboards in a clinical patient review in another. As a Forward Deployed Software Engineer, I work on many projects to deliver meaningful impact to my clients.

          When I'm not working, you can usually find me playing with my super cute pup (his name is Tofu), playing video games or trying out a new creative hobby (currently, that's baking with my little sister, and I'm a huge fan of arts and crafts). I also really enjoy hanging out with friends in my hometown of Brooklyn, New York - especially when there's food involved!

          Press "T" for a fun surprise!
