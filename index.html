    <p id = "section_text_code"> When I was only 10 years old, I created my very first website with HTML, CSS and javascript - a website about cupcakes! It was glorious with tons of pictures and recipes for all different kinds of cupcakes. Like cupcakes, computer programming has been a consistent love of mine for a long time. <br><br> I was always mathematically inclined - math always felt logical and puzzle-like, while English was often difficult (especially as a non-native English speaker when I was younger - with immigrant family members who spoke almost no English). I love the puzzle-like nature of computer science and the feeling when you've created something (with no bugs!). <br><br> I didn't realize that being in computer science was a possible career route until my junior year of high school. I entered a program called "Girls Who Code" that changed my life forever. Girls Who Code taught me basic computer science foundations, leadership skills and most importantly, that I could be a Software Engineer if I put my mind to it. <br><br> From then on, I pursued my passion like a mouse chasing a ball of cheese. I joined many different computer science organizations such as CodeNow and #BuiltByGirls, competed in hackathons like the TechCrunch Hackathon and NY SpaceApps, and participated in competitions such as the #BuiltByGirls Challenge. I am now a sophomore studying Computer Science at Smith College that is working on software, machine learning, image processsing and more.</p>

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
